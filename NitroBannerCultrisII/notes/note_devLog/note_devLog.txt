* solution to backwards horizontal aim turning: negative the y
	on the way in to rotate2Dvector(), negative it again after
	it comes out, see comment in scr_general
* solution to fucked up vertical aim turning: rewrite rotatey
	transformation in fakeCam.project() to do the same proper
	usage of rotate2Dvector() twice, once on XY then on XZ, no
	need for birdsEyeMagnitude or even the "To" 3D coordinate
- fakeCam.xTo,yTo,zTo,birdsEyeMagnitude,updateAim()
> behind-cam culling still needs to be implemented, which adds
	complication as it takes into consideration geometry between
	lone points (currently the fakeCam is not smart enough to
	deal with anything more advanced than lone points)
> math can probably be concise-ified
